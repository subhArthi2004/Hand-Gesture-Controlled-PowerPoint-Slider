This project implements an AI-powered, vision-based presentation control system that allows users to navigate PowerPoint slides through simple hand gestures. Using real-time hand landmark detection, the system accurately interprets index finger movements and converts them into slide navigation commands, enabling seamless and contactless control during presentations.

Advantages:

Enables touch-free and hygienic slide control

Enhances presentation flow and speaker confidence

Uses natural gestures, reducing learning effort

Low-cost solution using only a standard webcam

Platform-independent and lightweight

Demonstrates practical application of computer vision and human–computer interaction
